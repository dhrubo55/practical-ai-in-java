**Sarah (PM):** Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining our sprint planning meeting today. Before we dive into planning Sprint 7, let's quickly review how Sprint 6 went. Mike, can you share the velocity from the last sprint?

**Mike (Tech Lead):** Sure. We completed 34 story points out of the 40 we committed to. We had to roll over the account settings API endpoint work due to some unexpected complexity with the permission model. Overall though, I'd say it was a productive sprint.

**Sarah (PM):** Thanks Mike. That's still pretty good velocity. Let's make sure we address those permission model complexities in this sprint. Jamie, anything from QA perspective about the last sprint?

**Jamie (QA):** Yes, we identified 7 bugs in the dashboard component, 5 of which were high priority. The team fixed all the high priority ones, but we should add the remaining 2 to this sprint. Also, we need to improve our test coverage for the notification system – we're only at about 65% coverage there.

**Sarah (PM):** Good point about the test coverage. Let's prioritize that this sprint. Now, let's look at the backlog for Sprint 7. Our main focus should be finalizing the user dashboard and beginning work on the reporting module. Alex, how's the dashboard front-end coming along?

**Alex (Frontend):** The core dashboard is about 80% complete. The data visualization components are working well, but we still need to implement the filter system and the export functionality. I estimate that's about 8 story points of work remaining.

**Sarah (PM):** Thanks Alex. Priya, what about the backend services for the reporting module?

**Priya (Backend):** I've been researching the best approach for the reporting API. We have two options: we could build a synchronous API for smaller reports or an asynchronous job-based system for larger reports. The async approach would take longer to implement but would be more scalable for large data sets.

**Mike (Tech Lead):** I think we should go with the async approach. We know from user research that some clients will be exporting large datasets.

**Carlos (UX):** Agreed. But we need to make sure the UI clearly communicates the status of report generation to users. I've created some mockups for this that I can share after the meeting.

**Sarah (PM):** That makes sense. Let's go with the async approach. Priya, can you break down the tasks and estimate the effort?

**Priya (Backend):** I think the entire reporting service will be about 21 points over the next two sprints. For this sprint, I can set up the basic infrastructure and job queue system which would be around 13 points.

**Sarah (PM):** Thanks. That's a significant chunk of our capacity. Let's allocate that and see what else we can fit in. Jamie, what testing tasks do we need to prioritize?

**Jamie (QA):** In addition to the notification system test coverage I mentioned, we should create an automated test suite for the dashboard filters once Alex completes that work. That would be about 5 points.

**Sarah (PM):** Great. Mike, anything on the technical debt side we need to address this sprint?

**Mike (Tech Lead):** Yes, we need to upgrade our authentication library to address a security vulnerability that was reported last week. It's not critical yet, but it should be done in the next 2-3 weeks. I'd estimate that at 3 points.

**Sarah (PM):** Let's include that in this sprint then. Carlos, any design work we need to prioritize?

**Carlos (UX):** I need to finalize the design for the reporting module UI. That will take me about 3 days. Once that's done, I can create the necessary assets for Alex. Also, I received feedback on the dashboard from the usability testing – there are some suggestions for improving the layout for mobile devices.

**Sarah (PM):** Can you quantify the mobile layout improvements in story points?

**Carlos (UX):** Probably around 5 points for design and implementation combined.

**Alex (Frontend):** That sounds right. I can handle the implementation part if Carlos provides the updated designs.

**Sarah (PM):** OK, let's sum up what we have so far:
- Dashboard completion (filters and export) - 8 points
- Reporting module backend infrastructure - 13 points
- Dashboard test automation - 5 points
- Auth library upgrade - 3 points
- Reporting module UI design - not pointed (design task)
- Mobile dashboard improvements - 5 points
- Remaining low-priority bugs from last sprint - 3 points

That's a total of 37 points. Our average velocity is around 35, so this seems like a reasonable commitment. Does anyone foresee any issues or have any concerns?

**Priya (Backend):** I'll be out next Wednesday for a doctor's appointment, but I don't think it will impact my deliverables.

**Mike (Tech Lead):** I might need some help from Alex on the auth library upgrade since it affects the frontend authentication flow.

**Alex (Frontend):** That's fine. Let's schedule some time on Thursday to pair on that.

**Sarah (PM):** Great. Let's also make sure we document the permission model issues we encountered last sprint so we can address them properly. Priya, can you create a technical design document for the reporting service that outlines the async approach and how it will scale?

**Priya (Backend):** Yes, I'll have that ready by tomorrow.

**Sarah (PM):** Perfect. Let's also schedule a quick design review for Carlos's reporting UI designs – how about Thursday afternoon?

**Carlos (UX):** Works for me. I'll send out an invite.

**Sarah (PM):** OK, I think we have a good plan for Sprint 7. Before we wrap up, are there any dependencies or blockers we need to address?

**Jamie (QA):** We need to set up a new test environment for the reporting module. I'll need help from DevOps for that.

**Mike (Tech Lead):** I'll talk to Dave in DevOps about that today.

**Sarah (PM):** Great! I'll update the sprint board with all these items and assign the initial tasks. Our daily standup will continue at 9:30 AM. Sprint 7 starts tomorrow and will run for the next two weeks. Any final questions or comments?

**Alex (Frontend):** Will the product demo for stakeholders still be on the last Friday of the sprint?

**Sarah (PM):** Yes, mark your calendars for the 25th at 2 PM for the demo. I'll make sure the stakeholders are invited.

**Mike (Tech Lead):** One last thing – we should schedule some time to refine the backlog for Sprint 8, especially for the reporting module second phase.

**Sarah (PM):** Good point. Let's do that next Tuesday. I'll send out an invite for that as well. If there's nothing else, thanks everyone for your input. Let's make Sprint 7 a productive one!
